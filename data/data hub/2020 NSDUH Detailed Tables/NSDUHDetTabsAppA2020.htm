<h2>Appendix&nbsp;A: Key Definitions for the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</h2>

<p>This glossary is a resource to provide definitions for many of the commonly used measures and terms in tables and reports from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Where relevant, cross&#045;references to details in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report also are provided.</p>

<p>For some key terms, specific question wording is provided for clarity. In some situations, information also is included about specific gate questions. In many instances, a gate question is the first question in a series of related questions. How a respondent answers the gate question affects whether the respondent is asked additional questions in that section of the interview or is routed to the next section of the interview. In some sections of the interview, respondents may be asked more than one gate question to determine whether they are asked additional questions in that section or are routed to the next section.<sup><a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Because of changes to data collection procedures and other methodological changes for 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#045;19), caution is advised when comparing estimates between 2020 and prior years. See Chapters&nbsp;2, 3, and 6 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional information on these changes. For details on comparing estimates from the 2019 NSDUH and prior years, see Appendix&nbsp;A in the methodological summary and definitions report for the 2019 NSDUH.<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2">2</a></sup></p>

	<dt><span class="bold">ACASI</span></dt>
	<dd>ACASI stands for audio computer&#045;assisted self&#045;interviewing and applies to in&#045;person NSDUH data collection. ACASI questions appear on a laptop computer screen while an audio recording of the questions plays on headphones. Respondents enter their answers directly into the computer without the interviewer knowing how they answered. ACASI is designed to provide the respondent with a highly private and confidential mode for responding to questions about illicit drug use and other sensitive behaviors. The audio also is helpful for respondents with limited reading skills. For information on in&#045;person interview sections administered using ACASI, see the list of the content of the 2020 NSDUH in&#045;person instruments for Quarter&nbsp;1 and Quarter&nbsp;4.<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3">3</a></sup></dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Alcohol Use</span></dt>
	<dd>Measures of use of alcohol in the respondent&#8217;s lifetime, the past year, and the past month were derived from responses to the questions in the alcohol section of the questionnaire about lifetime and recency of use (i.e., &#8220;Have you ever, even once, had a drink of any type of alcoholic beverage?&#8221; and &#8220;How long has it been since you last drank an alcoholic beverage?&#8221;). The question about recency of use was asked if respondents previously reported any use of alcohol in their lifetime.</dd>

	<dd>The following definitional information preceded the question about lifetime alcohol use: &#8220;The next questions are about alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, brandy, and mixed drinks. Listed on the next screen are examples of the types of beverages we are interested in. Please review this list carefully before you answer these questions. These questions are about drinks of alcoholic beverages. Throughout these questions, by a &#8216;drink,&#8217; we mean a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it. We are not asking about times when you only had a sip or two from a drink.&#8221;</dd>

	<dd>SEE: &#8220;Binge Use of Alcohol,&#8221; &#8220;Current Use or Misuse,&#8221; &#8220;Heavy Use of Alcohol,&#8221; &#8220;Lifetime Use or Misuse,&#8221; &#8220;Past Month Use or Misuse,&#8221; &#8220;Past Year Use or Misuse,&#8221; &#8220;Recency of Use or Misuse,&#8221; and &#8220;Underage Alcohol Use.&#8221;</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)</span></dt>
	<dd>Starting in 2020, alcohol use disorder (AUD) was defined as meeting criteria in the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span>, 5th edition (DSM&#045;5<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4">4</a></sup>). Respondents who used alcohol on 6 or more days in the past 12&nbsp;months were classified as having an alcohol use disorder if they met two or more of the following criteria: (1)&nbsp;used alcohol in larger amounts or for a longer time period than intended; (2)&nbsp;had a persistent desire or made unsuccessful attempts to cut down on alcohol use; (3)&nbsp;spent a great deal of time in activities to obtain, use, or recover from alcohol use; (4)&nbsp;felt a craving or strong desire to use alcohol; (5)&nbsp;engaged in recurrent alcohol use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home; (6)&nbsp;continued to use alcohol despite social or interpersonal problems caused by the effects of alcohol; (7)&nbsp;gave up or reduced important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of alcohol use; (8)&nbsp;continued to use alcohol in physically hazardous situations; (9)&nbsp;continued to use alcohol despite physical or psychological problems caused by alcohol use; (10)&nbsp;developed tolerance (i.e., needing to use alcohol more than before to get desired effects or noticing that the same amount of alcohol use had less effect than before); and (11)&nbsp;experienced a required number of withdrawal symptoms after cutting back or stopping alcohol use. Prior to 2020, AUD estimates were based on criteria in the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span>, 4th edition (DSM&#045;IV<sup><a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5">5</a></sup>). See Section&nbsp;3.4.3 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Alcohol Use in Combination with Illicit Drug Use</span></dt>
	<dd>Starting in 2015, respondents who used alcohol in the past 30 days were classified as having &#8220;alcohol use in combination with illicit drug use&#8221; if they reported in the consumption of alcohol section of the questionnaire that they used one or more of six selected illicit drugs with their most recent use of alcohol or within a couple of hours of drinking alcohol. The selected illicit drugs respondents were asked about using in combination with alcohol were marijuana, cocaine or crack, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and methamphetamine. Respondents who used both alcohol and selected illicit drugs in the past month were asked about this behavior. Respondents could report the use of more than one selected illicit drug in combination with alcohol. The definition since 2015 has not included alcohol use in combination with prescription pain relievers, prescription tranquilizers, prescription stimulants, or prescription sedatives because respondents were asked about misuse of these prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in combination with alcohol at any point in the past 30 days (i.e., not just the last time they used alcohol).</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Alternative Service Professional</span></dt>
	<dd>The alternative service professional measure from the adult depression and adolescent depression sections of the questionnaire was defined as a (1)&nbsp;religious or spiritual advisor (e.g., minister, priest, or rabbi) or (2)&nbsp;herbalist, chiropractor, acupuncturist, or massage therapist seen because of sadness, discouragement, or lack of interest (for adults) or sadness, discouragement, or boredom (for adolescents). Respondents could report they received treatment from more than one of these categories of alternative service professionals.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN)</span></dt>
	<dd>American Indian or Alaska Native only, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin, including North American, Central American, or South American Indian as reported in the core demographics section at the beginning of the questionnaire. This definition does not include respondents reporting two or more races. Respondents reporting they were American Indians or Alaska Natives and of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin were classified as Hispanic.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Analysis Weight</span></dt>
	<dd>Person&#045;level analysis weights were created for analyses of NSDUH data so that the estimates from respondents&#8217; data represented the national population of interest for a given survey year. In each year, person&#045;level analysis weights reflected probabilities of selection, adjustment for nonresponse, poststratification to known population control totals, and controls for extreme weights when necessary. See Section&nbsp;2.3.4 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details on how the weights are created.</dd>

	<dd>For 2020, multiple person&#045;level weights were produced due to the changes in 2020 NSDUH data collection methods. The main analysis weights were produced to analyze combined 2020 Quarter&nbsp;1 and Quarter&nbsp;4 data. In addition, a relatively high number of web respondents in Quarter&nbsp;4 of 2020 did not complete the interview (i.e., break&#045;offs). Therefore, person&#045;level break&#045;off analysis weights were produced for analyzing combined Quarter&nbsp;1 and 4 data for unimputed outcomes based on questions that occurred in the mental health or later sections of the questionnaire. See Chapters&nbsp;2 and 3 in the 2020 methodological summary and definitions report for details on when the break&#045;off analysis weights were used to produce estimates for 2020. Additional Quarter&nbsp;1 and Quarter&nbsp;4 main analysis weights and break&#045;off analysis weights were produced for analyzing quarterly data separately.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Any Use of Prescription Psychotherapeutics</span></dt>
	<dd>Any use of psychotherapeutics refers to use of prescription psychotherapeutic medication (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives) for any reason. This could include use of prescriptions of one&#8217;s own as directed by a doctor or misuse of these medications. Starting in 2015, respondents were asked in the respective questionnaire sections whether they used a series of specific prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in the past 12&nbsp;months. For pain relievers, stimulants, and sedatives, respondents were instructed not to include the use of over&#045;the&#045;counter (OTC) drugs (e.g., aspirin, Tylenol<sup>&reg;</sup>, Advil<sup>&reg;</sup>, Aleve<sup>&reg;</sup>, Dexatrim<sup>&reg;</sup>, No&#045;Doz<sup>&reg;</sup>, Hydroxycut<sup>&reg;</sup>, 5&#045;Hour Energy<sup>&reg;</sup>, Sominex<sup>&reg;</sup>, Unisom<sup>&reg;</sup>, Benadryl<sup>&reg;</sup>, Nytol<sup>&reg;</sup>). This instruction not to include OTC drugs was not included for tranquilizers because all tranquilizers in the United States currently require a prescription. The questions about any use in the past 12&nbsp;months included electronic images of pills or other forms of the drugs (where applicable) to aid respondents in recalling whether they used a specific prescription drug in the past 12&nbsp;months. Respondents who did not report use in the past 12&nbsp;months of any specific prescription psychotherapeutic drug within a category (e.g., prescription pain relievers) were asked whether they ever, even once, used any prescription psychotherapeutic drug within that category (e.g., any prescription pain reliever). Respondents were not asked about any use of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in the past 30 days.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Asian</span></dt>
	<dd>Asian only, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin, in accordance with federal standards for reporting race and ethnicity data.<sup><a href="#ftn6" id="ftnref6">6</a></sup> This definition is based on reports in the core demographics section at the beginning of the interview in which respondents described themselves as being Asian. The definition does not include respondents reporting two or more races. Respondents reporting they were Asian and of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin were classified as Hispanic. Specific Asian groups asked about were Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Other Asian.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">At Risk for Initiation</span></dt>
	<dd>Individuals were classified as being at risk for initiation in the past 12&nbsp;months if they did not use a given substance in their lifetime or if they used it for the first time in the past year. Individuals who first used the substance more than 12&nbsp;months ago were no longer considered to be at risk for initiation. NSDUH can identify individuals at risk for initiation of use of marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, hallucinogens, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), Ecstasy, inhalants, methamphetamine, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, and alcohol and also those at risk for initiation of daily cigarette use based on responses from the respective substance use questionnaire sections.</dd>

	<dd>NSDUH cannot identify individuals at risk for initiation of illicit drug use, misuse of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (i.e., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives), benzodiazepines, misuse of opioids, and use of illicit drugs other than marijuana. For these measures, the 2020 detailed tables do not show percentages for initiation among those at risk for initiation due to questionnaire changes starting with the 2015 NSDUH. Specifically, the focus for questions about the misuse of specific psychotherapeutic drugs changed in 2015 from the lifetime to the past year period. Because of this change, respondents who last misused any prescription psychotherapeutic drug in a category (e.g., pain relievers) more than 12&nbsp;months ago may underreport misuse. These respondents who did not report misuse that occurred more than 12&nbsp;months ago would be misclassified as still being at risk for initiation. This change also affected aggregate risk for initiation measures that include prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (i.e., opioids, benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, illicit drugs other than marijuana). See Sections&nbsp;3.4.2 and 4.5.3 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details.</dd>

	<dd>Additionally, NSDUH cannot identify individuals at risk for initiation of use of any tobacco product. Aggregate measures for the use of tobacco products include the use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, or pipe tobacco. However, respondents are not asked initiation questions for pipe tobacco; therefore, the aggregate risk for initiation of use of any tobacco product cannot be determined.</dd>

	<dd>In addition, respondents are not asked questions about the initiation of use or misuse of GHB, nonprescription cough and cold medicines, kratom, nicotine vaping, synthetic marijuana, or synthetic stimulants. Therefore, there are no risk for initiation measures for these substances.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Benzodiazepine Use or Misuse</span></dt>
	<dd>Measures of the use or misuse of benzodiazepines in the past year were derived from questions in the tranquilizer and sedative sections of the questionnaire that asked respondents about any use (i.e., for any reason) in the past 12&nbsp;months of specific prescription tranquilizers or sedatives classified as benzodiazepines (see below). Respondents who reported they used specific benzodiazepines were asked for each drug whether they used it in the past 12&nbsp;months in any way not directed by a doctor. Examples of use in any way a doctor did not direct respondents to use prescription tranquilizers or sedatives (including benzodiazepines) were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug.</dd>

	<dd>Questions about the past year use and misuse of benzodiazepines covered the following subcategories of benzodiazepines prescribed as tranquilizers: <span class="italic">alprazolam products</span> (Xanax<sup>&reg;</sup>, Xanax<sup>&reg;</sup> XR, generic alprazolam, or generic extended&#045;release alprazolam), <span class="italic">lorazepam products</span> (Ativan<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic lorazepam), <span class="italic">clonazepam products</span> (Klonopin<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic clonazepam), or <span class="italic">diazepam products</span> (Valium<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic diazepam). Questions covered the following subcategories of benzodiazepines prescribed as sedatives: flurazepam (also known as Dalmane<sup>&reg;</sup>), <span class="italic">temazepam products</span> (Restoril<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic temazepam), or <span class="italic">triazolam products</span> (Halcion<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic triazolam). These drugs were specified in the questionnaire but are not an exhaustive list of benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepine category also includes benzodiazepines that respondents specified that they misused as other tranquilizers or sedatives.</dd>

	<dd>Respondents were asked about their use and misuse of benzodiazepines only for the past year; therefore, there are no lifetime or past month measures for benzodiazepines. See Section&nbsp;4.5 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details.</dd>

	<dd>Population counts are from the 2010 census representing the resident population.

Small MSAs (small metro) have a total population of fewer than 1 million. Nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) areas include counties in micropolitan statistical areas as well as counties outside of both metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. Nonmetro counties with a population of 20,000 or more in urbanized areas are classified as &#8220;urbanized,&#8221; nonmetro counties with a population of at least 2,500 but fewer than 20,000 in urbanized areas are classified as &#8220;less urbanized,&#8221; and nonmetro counties with a population of fewer than 2,500 in urbanized areas are classified as &#8220;completely rural.&#8221; The terms &#8220;urbanized,&#8221; &#8220;less urbanized,&#8221; and &#8220;completely rural&#8221; for counties are not based on the relative proportion of the county population in urbanized areas but rather on the absolute size of the population in urbanized areas. For example, some counties classified as &#8220;less urbanized&#8221; had over 50&nbsp;percent of the county population residing in urbanized areas, but this represented fewer than 20,000 people in the county.

	<dt><span class="bold">Education Level</span></dt>
	<dd>Starting in 2015, educational attainment among adult respondents aged 18 or older was based on respondents&#8217; reports in the core demographics section at the beginning of the interview about the highest grade or level of school they completed, including the highest degree they completed. Response options for respondents who completed the 11th grade or lower were presented in terms of single years of education, ranging from 0 if respondents never attended school up to the 11th grade. Response options for higher levels of education than the 11th grade indicated whether respondents received a high school diploma, completed the 12th grade without receiving a diploma, received a general educational development (GED) certificate, obtained some college credit but did not receive a degree, or received some kind of college degree (i.e., associate&#8217;s, bachelor&#8217;s, master&#8217;s, doctoral, or professional).</dd>

	<dd>Adult respondents were classified into four categories based on their answers: (1)&nbsp;less than high school, (2)&nbsp;high school graduate, (3)&nbsp;some college or associate&#8217;s degree, and (4)&nbsp;college graduate. Starting in 2015, adults who indicated they completed the 12th grade but did not receive a high school diploma were classified as having less than a high school education. Adults who indicated they received a high school diploma or GED were classified as high school graduates. Adults who received an associate&#8217;s degree were classified in the &#8220;some college&#8221; category, along with adults who received some college credit but had not obtained a degree. Adults who indicated they received a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher were classified as being college graduates.</dd>

	<dd>Prior to 2015, respondents were asked to report the highest grade or year of school they completed. Adult respondents who reported completing the 12th grade were classified as high school graduates, and adults who reported completing 4 or more years of college or university were classified as being college graduates. However, these assumptions were not always true for such respondents. The question prior to 2015 also did not capture information on the receipt of an associate&#8217;s degree.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Employment Status</span></dt>
	<dd>Respondents were asked to report in the employment section of the questionnaire whether they worked in the week prior to the interview and, if not, whether they had a job despite not working in the past week. Respondents who worked in the past week or who reported having a job despite not working were asked whether they usually work 35 hours or more per week. Respondents who did not work in the past week but had a job were asked to report why they did not work in the past week despite having a job. Respondents who did not have a job in the past week were asked to report why they did not have a job in the past week. Starting in 2015, these questions were self&#045;administered for in&#045;person respondents using audio computer&#045;assisted self&#045;interviewing (ACASI) instead of being interviewer administered through computer&#045;assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).

Similarly, respondents who reported not having a job and looking for work also were classified as not being in the labor force if they did not report making specific efforts to find work in the past 30 days. Those respondents who reported having no job and provided no additional information could not have their labor force status determined and were therefore assigned to the Other employment category.</dd>

	<dd>Family income was estimated by asking respondents about their total personal income and total family income, based on the following questions in the income section of the questionnaire: &#8220;Of these income groups, which category best represents [your/SAMPLE MEMBER&#8217;s] total personal income during [the previous calendar year]?&#8221; and &#8220;Of these income groups, which category best represents [your/SAMPLE MEMBER&#8217;s] total combined family income during [the previous calendar year]?&#8221; Family was defined as any related member in the household, including all foster relationships and unmarried partners (including same&#045;sex partners). It excluded roommates, boarders, and other nonrelatives. Categories for family income since 2015 ranged from less than $1,000 to $150,000 or more. From 2004 to 2014, categories ranged from less than $1,000 to $100,000 or more. From 2002 to 2004, the highest level of income was $75,000 or more.</dd>

	<dd>NOTE: If no other family members were living with the respondent, total family income was based on information about the respondent&#8217;s total personal income. For youths aged 12 to 17 and those respondents who were unable to respond to the health insurance or income questions, proxy responses were accepted from a household member identified as being better able to give the correct information about health insurance and income.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Gate Question</span></dt>
	<dd>A gate question is an initial question that asks whether the behavior or characteristic of interest is applicable to the respondent. Thus, these questions function to open or close a &#8220;gate&#8221; in the interview by governing whether respondents are asked additional questions about the topic of interest or skip remaining questions about that topic. Sections of the questionnaire about specific topics may include a single gate question or more than one gate question (e.g., hallucinogens, inhalants). An affirmative response to a question leads to respondents being asked a series of other related questions. A response other than an affirmative one (or no affirmative responses to all gate questions in sections with more than one gate question) results in respondents skipping additional questions on that topic and being routed to the next set of topics in the interview.<sup><a href="#ftn19" id="ftnref19">19</a></sup></dd>

Clinicians do not include impairment in functioning due to physical or environmental limitations. When adequate information is available, numeric ratings for the GAF range from 1 to 100. Lower values on the rating scale indicate a greater extent of impairment due to the presence of a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. In follow&#045;up interviews conducted in 2008 to 2012 with a subset of adult NSDUH respondents, mental health clinicians used the GAF and rated respondents&#8217; worst period of functioning in the past 12&nbsp;months because of a mental disorder.

This is referred to as &#8220;past year initiation.&#8221;</dd>

	<dd>Initiation estimates were based on retrospective questions asked of lifetime users in the respective substance use questionnaire sections about the age at first use of substances and the year and month of first use for recent initiates, along with the respondent&#8217;s date of birth and the interview date. However, questions about first misuse of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs were asked only of respondents who reported they misused prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in the past 12&nbsp;months. Respondents who misused prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in the past 12&nbsp;months were classified as past year initiates if they reported only past year initiation of the drugs they misused in that period in the respective substance use sections and they reported they did not misuse any prescription psychotherapeutic drug in that category prior to the past 12&nbsp;months.</dd>

	<dd>Past year initiates can be identified in NSDUH for the use of marijuana, cocaine, crack, heroin, hallucinogens, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), Ecstasy, inhalants, methamphetamine, cigarettes (including daily cigarette use), smokeless tobacco, cigars, and alcohol. Past year initiates also can be identified for the specific misuse of prescription pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. Past year initiates cannot be identified in NSDUH for the aggregate substance use measures of use of illicit drugs, use of illicit drugs other than marijuana, the misuse of any prescription psychotherapeutic drug, tranquilizer or sedative, benzodiazepines, and opioids. For these measures, the 2020 detailed tables and reports do not present initiation estimates due to questionnaire changes starting with the 2015 NSDUH. Additionally, estimates cannot be identified for past year initiation of use of any tobacco product because respondents are not asked an initiation question for pipe tobacco. For all initiation estimates, respondents who are immigrants were included regardless of whether their first use or misuse occurred inside or outside the United States.</dd>

Since 2008, adult respondents have first been asked in the mental health section of the questionnaire about these symptoms for the past 30 days. Adults are then asked if they had a period in the past 12&nbsp;months when they felt more depressed, anxious, or emotionally stressed than they felt during the past 30 days. If so, they are asked the K6 questions for the 1 month in the past 12&nbsp;months when they felt the worst. Responses to these six questions for the past 30 days and (if applicable) the past 12&nbsp;months are coded and summed to produce a score ranging from 0 to 24; if respondents are asked the K6 questions for both the past 30 days and past 12&nbsp;months, the higher of the two scores is chosen as the final score for the past year reference period. Higher K6 total scores indicate greater distress. The K6 scale provides a measure of psychological distress and does not directly measure the presence of a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, nor does it capture information on functional impairment due to having psychological distress or a mental disorder. The K6 and scales for measuring functional impairment (the Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS]<sup><a href="#ftn35" id="ftnref35">35</a></sup> only in 2008 and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]<sup><a href="#ftn36" id="ftnref36">36</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#ftn37" id="ftnref37">37</a></sup> in 2008 to the present) are used in models that predict whether a respondent can be categorized as having serious mental illness (SMI).

	<dd>Severe impairment was defined by the level of role interference for adults or the level of problems for youths with a past year major depressive episode (MDE) when their depression symptoms were most severe (for adults) or worst (for youths). Impairment was defined based on the role domains for adults aged 18 or older and for youths aged 12 to 17 in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Respondents with a past year MDE and ratings of 7 or greater for interference (for adults) or problems (for youths) in one or more role domains were classified as having an MDE with severe impairment. The severe impairment measures asked about in the respective depression questionnaire sections are defined using different role domains for adults and youths.

	<dt class="ind1"><span class="bold">Specialty</span></dt>
	<dd class="ind2">Specialty mental health settings for youths include outpatient, inpatient, or residential mental health settings. The outpatient settings include (1)&nbsp;private therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, or counselors; (2)&nbsp;mental health clinics or centers; (3)&nbsp;partial day hospitals or day treatment programs; and (4)&nbsp;in&#045;home therapists, counselors, or family preservation workers. The inpatient settings include (1)&nbsp;hospitals and (2)&nbsp;residential treatment centers. Youths were classified as having received mental health services at a specialty setting if they reported receiving treatment or counseling in any of these settings for emotional or behavioral problems.</dd>

	<dt class="ind1"><span class="bold">Nonspecialty</span></dt>
	<dd class="ind2">Nonspecialty mental health settings for youths include the education, general medical, juvenile justice, and child welfare settings. The <span class="italic">education</span> setting includes mental health services from (1)&nbsp;school social workers, school psychologists, or school counselors; and (2)&nbsp;special schools or school programs (within a regular school) for students with emotional or behavioral problems.

A statistical model predicting the likelihood of having mental illness was developed based on a subsample of adult NSDUH respondents from 2008 to 2012 who completed a clinical follow&#045;up interview after the main NSDUH interview. The follow&#045;up interviews consisted of detailed mental health assessments administered by trained mental health clinicians. The dependent variable for mental illness in the model was established through the clinical interviews using modules from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM&#045;IV&#045;TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Non&#045;patient Edition (SCID&#045;I/NP)<sup><a href="#ftn46" id="ftnref46">46</a></sup> for the following past year disorders or symptoms: major depressive disorder (including major depressive episode [MDE]), dysthymic disorder, bipolar I disorder (including manic episode), specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), agoraphobia (without history of panic disorder), obsessive&#045;compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, adjustment disorder, and psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations or delusions). The clinical interviews also included the Global Assessment of Functioning scale to measure functional impairment. This model was used to predict adult NSDUH respondents&#8217; mental illness status based on their responses to questions in the main NSDUH interview on psychological distress (Kessler&#045;6 scale), functional impairment (an abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), past year MDE, past year suicidal thoughts, and age.

	<dd>The following definitional information preceded the question about lifetime use of methamphetamine: &#8220;Methamphetamine, also known as crank, ice, crystal meth, speed, glass, and many other names, is a stimulant that usually comes in crystal or powder forms. It can be smoked, &#8216;snorted,&#8217; swallowed or injected.&#8221; The methamphetamine section since 2015 has not included the prescription form of methamphetamine (Desoxyn<sup>&reg;</sup>) as an example.</dd>

	<dd>Starting in 2015, misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics (prescription pain relievers, prescription tranquilizers, prescription stimulants, or prescription sedatives) was defined as use &#8220;in any way a doctor did not direct you to use [it or them]&#8221; and focused on <span class="italic">behaviors</span> that constitute misuse of prescription drugs. Examples of misuse were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug. Prior to 2015, misuse (which was referred to as &#8220;nonmedical use&#8221;) was defined as (1)&nbsp;use of at least one of these medications without a prescription belonging to the respondent or (2)&nbsp;use that occurred simply for the experience or feeling the drug caused.</dd>

	<dd>Starting in 2015, respondents who reported in the respective prescription drug questionnaire sections that they used specific prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in the past 12&nbsp;months were shown a list of the drugs they used in the past 12&nbsp;months and were asked for each drug whether they used it (or them) in the past 12&nbsp;months in any way not directed by a doctor. Starting in 2017, respondents were reminded not to include over&#045;the&#045;counter drugs when they were asked if they used any other prescription pain reliever, stimulant, or sedative in the past 12&nbsp;months in any way not directed by a doctor. This reminder was not added for prescription tranquilizers because no tranquilizers were available over the counter.</dd>

	<dd>If respondents reported misuse of one or more specific drugs within a category in the past 12&nbsp;months, they were asked whether they used any drug in that category (e.g., prescription pain relievers) in the past 30 days in any way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use it or them. Respondents who reported any use of prescription psychotherapeutics in the past 12&nbsp;months but did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months or who reported any use in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, used any prescription psychotherapeutic drug within that category (e.g., any prescription pain reliever) in a way a doctor did not direct them to use it. Consequently, estimates of misuse in the lifetime or past month periods were available only for an overall prescription psychotherapeutic drug category (e.g., pain relievers) and not for specific prescription drugs within that category.</dd>

	<dd>Measures of use or misuse of prescription pain relievers in the respondent&#8217;s lifetime and past year were derived from a series of questions in the screener and main sections of the questionnaire for pain relievers that first asked respondents about any use (i.e., for any reason) of specific prescription pain relievers in the past 12&nbsp;months. Respondents were instructed not to include the use of over&#045;the&#045;counter (OTC) pain relievers, such as aspirin, Tylenol<sup>&reg;</sup>, Advil<sup>&reg;</sup>, or Aleve<sup>&reg;</sup>. Respondents who did not report use of any pain reliever in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, used prescription pain relievers.</dd>

	<dd>Respondents who reported they used specific prescription pain relievers in the past 12&nbsp;months for any reason were shown a list reminding them of the drugs they used in the past 12&nbsp;months. For each of these drugs, respondents were asked whether they misused it (or them) in the past 12&nbsp;months (i.e., use in any way a doctor did not direct them to use it). Examples of misuse were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug. Starting in 2017, respondents were reminded not to include OTC drugs when they were asked if they misused any other prescription pain reliever in the past 12&nbsp;months. If respondents reported misuse of one or more specific prescription pain relievers in the past 12&nbsp;months, they were asked whether they misused prescription pain relievers in the past 30 days. Respondents who reported any use of prescription pain relievers in the past 12&nbsp;months but did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months or who reported any use in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, misused any prescription pain reliever. Consequently, lifetime and past month estimates of the misuse of prescription pain relievers are available only for the overall pain reliever category and not for specific pain relievers.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Poverty Level</span></dt>
	<dd>Poverty level was defined by comparing a respondent&#8217;s total family income with the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s poverty thresholds (both measured in dollar amounts) in order to determine the poverty status of the respondent and the respondent&#8217;s family. Information on family income, size, and composition (i.e., number of children) was used to determine the respondent&#8217;s poverty level. The poverty level was calculated as a percentage of the poverty threshold by dividing a respondent&#8217;s reported total family income by the appropriate poverty threshold amount. Three categories for poverty level were defined relative to the poverty threshold: (1)&nbsp;less than 100&nbsp;percent (i.e., total family income was less than the poverty threshold); (2)&nbsp;100 to 199&nbsp;percent (i.e., total family income was at or above the poverty threshold but less than twice the poverty threshold); and (3)&nbsp;200&nbsp;percent or more (i.e., total family income was twice the poverty threshold or greater). In addition, the measure for poverty level excluded respondents aged 18 to 22 who were living in a college dormitory. Starting in 2015, the poverty level measures took into account the addition of new categories in 2015 for incomes of $100,000 to $149,999 and of $150,000 or more; in 2014, the highest income category was $100,000 or more.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Recency of Use or Misuse</span></dt>
	<dd>Respondents who previously reported any use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs other than prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in their lifetime in the respective questionnaire sections were asked about their most recent use of that substance. This information was the source for the lifetime, past year, and past month estimates of substance use or misuse. The questions &#8220;Have you ever, even once, used [substance name]?&#8221; and &#8220;How long has it been since you last used [substance name]?&#8221; were essentially the same for all substances other than tobacco products and prescription psychotherapeutic drugs.</dd>

	<dd>For tobacco products (cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, or pipe tobacco), a question first was asked about use in the past 30 days if respondents indicated ever using that tobacco product in their lifetime. Lifetime users of pipe tobacco were asked only about their use in the past 30 days. For tobacco products other than pipe tobacco, if the respondents did not use the product in the past 30 days, the recency question was asked as above, with the response options (1)&nbsp;more than 30 days ago but within the past 12&nbsp;months, (2)&nbsp;more than 12&nbsp;months ago but within the past 3 years, and (3)&nbsp;more than 3 years ago. For the remaining substances, the response options were (1)&nbsp;within the past 30 days, (2)&nbsp;more than 30 days ago but within the past 12&nbsp;months, and (3)&nbsp;more than 12&nbsp;months ago.</dd>

	<dd>For prescription psychotherapeutic drugs, respondents were not asked a single question about their most recent use or misuse. Most recent use of psychotherapeutic drugs for any reason was determined first from respondents&#8217; reports of any use of specific psychotherapeutic drugs within a category (e.g., prescription pain relievers) in the past 12&nbsp;months. Any use more than 12&nbsp;months ago was established from follow&#045;up questions about lifetime use that were asked if respondents did not report use in the past 12&nbsp;months of any specific prescription psychotherapeutic drug within a category. Similarly, most recent misuse of psychotherapeutic drugs (i.e., use in any way not directed by a doctor) was determined first from respondents&#8217; reports of misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months of specific psychotherapeutic drugs within a category respondents reported using in that period. If respondents reported misuse of any psychotherapeutic drug in the past 12&nbsp;months, misuse within the past 30 days was determined in one of two ways: (1)&nbsp;if respondents initiated misuse of a specific drug in the past 30 days or (2)&nbsp;otherwise, from a follow&#045;up question about misuse of any drug in that category in the past 30 days. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs more than 12&nbsp;months ago was established from follow&#045;up questions about lifetime use asked if respondents reported (1)&nbsp;any use of specific prescription psychotherapeutics in the past 12&nbsp;months, but they did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months; or (2)&nbsp;any use of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs in an overall category in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months.</dd>

	<dt><span class="bold">Rounding</span></dt>
	<dd>The decision rules for the rounding of percentages are as follows:</dd>
	
	<dd><ol>
	<li>If the second number to the right of the decimal point is greater than or equal to 5, the first number to the right of the decimal point is rounded up to the next higher number.</li>

	<li>If the second number to the right of the decimal point is less than 5, the first number to the right of the decimal point remains the same.</li>
	</ol></dd>
	
	<dd>Thus, an estimate of 16.55&nbsp;percent will have been rounded to 16.6&nbsp;percent, while an estimate of 16.44&nbsp;percent will have been rounded to 16.4&nbsp;percent. Although the percentages in the tables generally total 100&nbsp;percent, the use of rounding sometimes produces a total of slightly less than or more than 100&nbsp;percent. Rounding of estimates also needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results of tests for statistical significance because testing is done using unrounded estimates. Therefore, estimates rounded to the same value may not show the same results for statistical testing.</dd>

Respondents who misused prescription sedatives in the past 12&nbsp;months were classified as having a prescription sedative use disorder if they met two or more of the following criteria: (1)&nbsp;used sedatives in larger amounts or for a longer time period than intended; (2)&nbsp;had a persistent desire or made unsuccessful attempts to cut down on sedative use; (3)&nbsp;spent a great deal of time in activities to obtain, use, or recover from sedative use; (4)&nbsp;felt a craving or strong desire to use sedatives; (5)&nbsp;engaged in recurrent sedative use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home; (6)&nbsp;continued to use sedatives despite social or interpersonal problems caused by the effects of sedatives; (7)&nbsp;gave up or reduced important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of sedative use; (8)&nbsp;continued to use sedatives in physically hazardous situations; (9)&nbsp;continued to use sedatives despite physical or psychological problems caused by sedative use; (10)&nbsp;developed tolerance (i.e., needing to use sedatives more than before to get desired effects or noticing that the same amount of sedative use had less effect than before); and (11)&nbsp;experienced a required number of withdrawal symptoms after cutting back or stopping sedative use. Prior to 2020, sedative use disorder estimates were based on criteria in the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span>, 4th edition (DSM&#045;IV<sup><a href="#ftn65" id="ftnref65">65</a></sup>).

	<dt><span class="bold">Sedative Use or Misuse</span></dt>
	<dd>Measures of use or misuse of prescription sedatives in the respondent&#8217;s lifetime and past year were derived from a series of questions in the screener and main sections of the questionnaire for sedatives that first asked respondents about any use (i.e., for any reason) of specific prescription sedatives in the past 12&nbsp;months. Respondents were informed that these drugs are also called &#8220;downers&#8221; or &#8220;sleeping pills.&#8221; Respondents also were informed that people sometimes take these drugs to help them relax or help them sleep. Respondents were instructed not to include the use of over&#045;the&#045;counter (OTC) sedatives, such as Sominex<sup>&reg;</sup>, Unisom<sup>&reg;</sup>, Benadryl<sup>&reg;</sup>, or Nytol<sup>&reg;</sup>. Respondents who did not report use of any sedative in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, used prescription sedatives.</dd>

	<dd>Respondents who reported they used specific prescription sedatives in the past 12&nbsp;months for any reason were shown a list reminding them of the drugs they used in the past 12&nbsp;months. For each of these drugs, respondents were asked whether they misused it (or them) in the past 12&nbsp;months (i.e., use in any way a doctor did not direct them to use it). Examples of misuse were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug. Starting in 2017, respondents were reminded not to include OTC drugs when they were asked if they misused any other prescription sedative in the past 12&nbsp;months. If respondents reported misuse of one or more specific prescription sedatives in the past 12&nbsp;months, they were asked whether they misused prescription sedatives in the past 30 days. Respondents who reported any use of prescription sedatives in the past 12&nbsp;months but did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months or who reported any use in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, misused any prescription sedative. Consequently, lifetime or past month estimates of the misuse of prescription sedatives are available only for the overall prescription sedative category and not for specific sedatives.</dd>

	<dd>Questions about past year use and misuse in the 2020 NSDUH covered the following subcategories of sedatives: <span class="italic">zolpidem products</span> (Ambien<sup>&reg;</sup>, Ambien<sup>&reg;</sup> CR, generic zolpidem, or generic extended&#045;release zolpidem); <span class="italic">eszopiclone products</span> (Lunesta<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic eszopiclone); <span class="italic">zaleplon products</span> (Sonata<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic zaleplon); <span class="italic">benzodiazepine sedatives</span> (flurazepam [also known as Dalmane<sup>&reg;</sup>], <span class="italic">temazepam products</span> [Restoril<sup>&reg;</sup>, or generic temazepam], or <span class="italic">triazolam products</span> [Halcion<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic triazolam]); <span class="italic">barbiturates</span> (Butisol<sup>&reg;</sup>, Seconal<sup>&reg;</sup>, or phenobarbital); or any other prescription sedative. Other prescription sedatives could include products similar to the specific sedatives listed previously. Questions were not asked about past month sedative use or misuse for the subtype categories.</dd>

Treatment received in self&#045;help groups was not considered substance use treatment at a specialty facility. Beginning with the 2006 survey, respondents also were asked in a different question whether they attended self&#045;help groups in the past 12&nbsp;months to receive help for their alcohol or drug use, regardless of whether they previously reported receiving any treatment in the past 12&nbsp;months.</dd>

	<dd>Starting in 2015, the measure of the receipt of substance use treatment in a self&#045;help group took into account changes to the computer&#045;assisted interviewing logic in 2015 for determining who was asked questions about their receipt of substance use treatment in the past year based on the addition of the new section of the questionnaire for methamphetamine and changes to the sections for hallucinogens, inhalants, and misuse of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives).

	<dd>Serious psychological distress (SPD) for adults is defined as having a score of 13 or higher on the Kessler&#045;6 (K6) scale. This scale consists of six questions that gather information on how frequently adult respondents experienced symptoms of psychological distress during the past month or the 1 month in the past year when they were at their worst emotionally. These questions in the mental health section of the questionnaire ask about the frequency of feeling (1)&nbsp;nervous, (2)&nbsp;hopeless, (3)&nbsp;restless or fidgety, (4)&nbsp;sad or depressed, (5)&nbsp;that everything was an effort, and (6)&nbsp;no good or worthless.<sup><a href="#ftn67" id="ftnref67">67</a></sup></dd>

	<dd>Past month SPD estimates are presented from 2009 onward. Estimates of past year SPD are presented from 2005 onward. From 2005 to 2007, the K6 questions asked only about the 1 month in the past year when adult respondents were at their worst emotionally, and past year SPD was defined from the resulting scores. Starting in 2008, however, the K6 questions were asked both for the past 30 days and (if applicable) the 1 month in the past year when adult respondents were at their worst emotionally.</dd>

	<dd>The maximum score of the two periods (i.e., past month and past year) was used to create the total past year score, and this score was used to define past year SPD for 2008 onward.

	<dd>A specialty facility for substance use treatment was defined as a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facility (inpatient or outpatient), a hospital (inpatient only), or a mental health center. See Section&nbsp;3.4.4 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details. Questions that were added to the 2020 NSDUH questionnaire in Quarter&nbsp;4 for the receipt of virtual (telehealth) services were not associated with a specific provider, location, or facility type. Therefore, receipt of these services was not included in the NSDUH measure for substance use treatment at a specialty facility.</dd>

	<dd>Starting in 2015, the measure of the receipt of treatment at a specialty facility took into account changes to the computer&#045;assisted interviewing logic in 2015 for determining who was asked questions about the receipt of treatment for a substance use problem based on the addition of the new section of the questionnaire for methamphetamine and changes to the sections for hallucinogens, inhalants, and misuse of prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives).

	<dd>Two types of statistical comparisons are generally presented in NSDUH reports and tables: (1)&nbsp;between two different time points, and (2)&nbsp;between members of demographic subgroups. When reports compare estimates between two points in time (e.g., 2018 and 2019) or between demographic subgroups (e.g., males and females), a significance level of .05 generally is used to determine whether these estimates are statistically different. If differences do not meet the criteria for statistical significance, the values of these estimates are not considered to be different from one another. Low precision estimates are not included in statistical tests. Also, testing can indicate significant differences involving seemingly identical percentages that have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. See Section&nbsp;3.2.3 in the 2020 NSDUH methodological summary and definitions report for additional details. For 2020 NSDUH tables and reports, no statistical testing was done between estimates in 2020 and prior years.</dd>

Respondents who misused prescription stimulants in the past 12&nbsp;months were classified as having a prescription stimulant use disorder if they met two or more of the following criteria: (1)&nbsp;used stimulants in larger amounts or for a longer time period than intended; (2)&nbsp;had a persistent desire or made unsuccessful attempts to cut down on stimulant use; (3)&nbsp;spent a great deal of time in activities to obtain, use, or recover from stimulant use; (4)&nbsp;felt a craving or strong desire to use stimulants; (5)&nbsp;engaged in recurrent stimulant use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home; (6)&nbsp;continued to use stimulants despite social or interpersonal problems caused by the effects of stimulants; (7)&nbsp;gave up or reduced important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of stimulant use; (8)&nbsp;continued to use stimulants in physically hazardous situations; (9)&nbsp;continued to use stimulants despite physical or psychological problems caused by stimulant use; (10)&nbsp;developed tolerance (i.e., needing to use stimulants more than before to get desired effects or noticing that the same amount of stimulant use had less effect than before); and (11)&nbsp;experienced a required number of withdrawal symptoms after cutting back or stopping stimulant use.

	<dt><span class="bold">Stimulant Use or Misuse</span></dt>
	<dd>Measures of use or misuse of prescription stimulants in the respondent&#8217;s lifetime and past year were derived from a series of questions in the screener and main sections of the questionnaire for stimulants that first asked respondents about any use (i.e., for any reason) of specific prescription stimulants in the past 12&nbsp;months. Respondents were informed that people sometimes take stimulants for attention deficit disorder, to lose weight, or to stay awake. Respondents were instructed not to include the use of over&#045;the&#045;counter (OTC) stimulants, such as Dexatrim<sup>&reg;</sup>, No&#045;Doz<sup>&reg;</sup>, Hydroxycut<sup>&reg;</sup>, or 5&#045;Hour Energy<sup>&reg;</sup>. Respondents who did not report use of any prescription stimulant in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, used prescription stimulants.</dd>

	<dd>Respondents who reported they used specific prescription stimulants in the past 12&nbsp;months for any reason were shown a list reminding them of the drugs they used in the past 12&nbsp;months. For each of these drugs, respondents were asked whether they misused it (or them) in the past 12&nbsp;months (i.e., use in any way a doctor did not direct them to use it). Examples of misuse were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug. Starting in 2017, respondents were reminded not to include OTC drugs when they were asked if they misused any other prescription stimulant in the past 12&nbsp;months. If respondents reported misuse of one or more specific prescription stimulants in the past 12&nbsp;months, they were asked whether they misused prescription stimulants in the past 30 days. Respondents who reported any use of prescription stimulants in the past 12&nbsp;months but did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months or who reported any use in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, misused any prescription stimulant. Consequently, lifetime or past month estimates of the misuse of prescription stimulants are available only for the overall prescription stimulant category and not for specific stimulants.</dd>

Other prescription stimulants could include products similar to the specific stimulants listed previously. Since 2015, methamphetamine has not been included as a prescription stimulant, unless respondents specified the prescription form of methamphetamine (Desoxyn<sup>&reg;</sup>) as another prescription stimulant they misused. Questions were not asked about past month stimulant use or misuse for the subtype categories.</dd>

For each of these drugs, respondents were asked whether they misused it (or them) in the past 12&nbsp;months (i.e., in any way a doctor did not direct them to use it). Examples of misuse were presented to respondents and included (1)&nbsp;use without a prescription of the respondent&#8217;s own; (2)&nbsp;use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told to take a drug; or (3)&nbsp;use in any other way a doctor did not direct the respondent to use a drug. If respondents reported misuse of one or more specific prescription tranquilizers in the past 12&nbsp;months, they were asked whether they misused prescription tranquilizers in the past 30 days. Respondents who reported any use of prescription tranquilizers in the past 12&nbsp;months but did not report misuse in the past 12&nbsp;months or who reported any use in their lifetime but not in the past 12&nbsp;months were asked whether they ever, even once, misused any prescription tranquilizer. Consequently, lifetime and past month estimates of the misuse of prescription tranquilizers are available only for the overall prescription tranquilizer category and not for specific tranquilizers.</dd>

	<dd>Questions about past year use and misuse in the 2020 NSDUH covered the following subcategories of tranquilizers: <span class="italic">benzodiazepine tranquilizers</span> (including <span class="italic">alprazolam products</span> [Xanax<sup>&reg;</sup>, Xanax<sup>&reg;</sup> XR, generic alprazolam, or generic extended&#045;release alprazolam], <span class="italic">lorazepam products</span> [Ativan<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic lorazepam], <span class="italic">clonazepam products</span> [Klonopin<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic clonazepam], or <span class="italic">diazepam products</span> [Valium<sup>&reg;</sup> or generic diazepam]); <span class="italic">muscle relaxants</span> (cyclobenzaprine [also known as Flexeril<sup>&reg;</sup>] or Soma<sup>&reg;</sup>); or any other prescription tranquilizer. Other prescription tranquilizers could include products similar to the specific tranquilizers listed previously. Questions were not asked about past month tranquilizer use or misuse for the subtype categories.</dd>

Starting in 2013, the categories for Guamanian or Chamorro and for Samoan were included in the NSDUH questionnaire.</dd>

	<dd>Respondents were allowed to choose more than one of these groups. Respondents who chose more than one category from among Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, and Other Pacific Islander (and no additional categories) were classified in a single category: Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Otherwise, respondents reporting two or more of the above groups and that they were not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin were included in a &#8220;Two or More Races&#8221; category. People reporting two or more races do not include respondents who reported more than one Asian subgroup but who reported &#8220;Asian&#8221; as their only race. Respondents reporting two or more races and reporting that they were of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin were classified as Hispanic.</dd>

	<dd>The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) consists of a series of questions used for assessing disturbances in social adjustment and behavior (i.e., functional impairment). A reduced set of WHODAS items was used in NSDUH.<sup><a href="#ftn81" id="ftnref81">81</a></sup> Adult respondents were asked in the mental health section of the questionnaire if they had difficulty doing any of the following eight activities during the 1 month when their emotions, nerves, or mental health interfered most with their daily activities: (1)&nbsp;remembering to do things they needed to do, (2)&nbsp;concentrating on doing something important when other things were going on around them, (3)&nbsp;going out of the house and getting around on their own, (4)&nbsp;dealing with people they did not know well, (5)&nbsp;participating in social activities, (6)&nbsp;taking care of household responsibilities, (7)&nbsp;taking care of daily responsibilities at work or school, and (8)&nbsp;getting daily work done as quickly as needed. These eight items were assessed on a 0 to 3 scale with categories of &#8220;no difficulty,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and &#8220;refuse&#8221;&nbsp;(0); &#8220;mild difficulty&#8221;&nbsp;(1); &#8220;moderate difficulty&#8221;&nbsp;(2); and &#8220;severe difficulty&#8221;&nbsp;(3). Some items had an additional category for respondents who did not engage in a particular activity (e.g., they did not leave the house on their own). Respondents who reported they did not engage in an activity were asked a follow&#045;up question to determine if they did not do so because of emotions, nerves, or mental health. Those who answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to this follow&#045;up question were subsequently assigned to the &#8220;severe difficulty&#8221; category; otherwise (i.e., for responses of &#8220;no,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t know,&#8221; or &#8220;refused&#8221;), they were assigned to the &#8220;no difficulty&#8221; category. Summing across the eight responses resulted in a total score with a range from 0 to 24.</dd>
