Questions on virtual substance use treatment were added in Quarter 4 of 2020. Estimates in this table do not include data from these questions. Data on virtual substance use treatment are included at the end of this section. See the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological Summary and Definitions for details. NOTE: Substance use disorder (SUD) estimates in 2020 are based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). SUD and related estimates are not comparable between 2020 and prior years of NSDUH, because prior years’ estimates were based on DSM-IV criteria. The 2020 estimates reflect additional methodological changes for the 2020 NSDUH. Due to these changes, significance testing between 2020 and prior years was not performed. See the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Methodological Summary and Definitions for details on these changes. 1 Perceived Need for Substance Use Treatment includes people who did not receive but felt they needed illicit drug or alcohol use treatment, as well as people who received treatment at a location other than a specialty facility but felt they needed additional treatment.

Estimates of SMI are a subset of estimates of any mental illness (AMI) because SMI is limited to people with AMI that resulted in serious functional impairment. These mental illness estimates are based on a predictive model and are not direct measures of diagnostic status.

Perception of unmet need was asked of all respondents regardless of their mental health. Respondents with unknown perception of unmet need information were excluded. 1 Respondents could indicate multiple reasons for not receiving mental health services; thus, these response categories are not mutually exclusive. 2 The Total column includes respondents with unknown mental health services information. 3 Mental Health Services for adults includes inpatient treatment/counseling, outpatient treatment/counseling, or use of prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health.

Respondents who did not indicate a reason were excluded from the analysis for the particular service category column. 2 Includes treatment/counseling received as outpatient care (e.g., care from a private therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or counselor; mental health clinic or center; partial day hospital or day treatment program; or in-home therapist, counselor, or family preservation worker) or inpatient or residential care (e.g., an overnight care in a hospital or residential treatment center). 3 Respondents who did not report their school enrollment status, who reported not being enrolled in school in the past 12 months, or who reported being home-schooled were not asked about receipt of mental health services or reasons for mental health care from this setting; however, respondents who reported not being enrolled in school in the past 12 months were classified as not having received mental health services from this setting. 4 The Received Mental Health Services row represents all youths who received mental health services regardless of whether a reason is known. The level of unknown data in this row is less than the level of unknown data in the reason for receipt of mental health service rows. The reason for receipt of mental health service rows have a smaller denominator compared to the overall received mental health services row due to the larger amount of unknown reason for treatment data. 5 Respondent self-reported in the other-specify question that he or she has a mental or neurological disorder as a reason for having received mental health services. This reason is one of the most commonly reported other reasons for having received mental health services. 6 Respondents with unknown or invalid responses to the other-specify question on Some Other Reason for Receiving Mental Health Services were excluded.
