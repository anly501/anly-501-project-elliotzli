  <h1>Exploring Data</h1>
  <p>With so much information being collected through data analysis in the business world today, we must have a way to paint a picture of that data so we can interpret it. The human brain is not well equipped to devour so much raw, unorganized information and turn it into something usable and understandable. Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs as they communicate data findings so that we can identify patterns and trends to gain insight and make better decisions faster.</p>
  <p>Interesting discovery: Age group 18-25 has the least amount of population diagnosed with mental illness while having the highest attempted suicide numbers. My non-technical conclusion is that they have less access to mental health resources than adults who are more financially independent.</p>
  
  <p><a href="../codes/Exploring Data/DV Any Mental Illess 2008-2020.html">Any Mental Illness 2008-2020</a></p>
  <p>The dataset shows that the majority of age, demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups have an increase in the population with mental illness. The age group 26-49 has the most population diagnosed with mental illness, whereas the age group 18-25 has a significantly lower number. Females are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness than their male counterparts.</p>
  <p>People in the north are less diagnosed with mental illness, and the situation is the opposite in the south. People in larger metropolitan areas have a higher number of mental illness diagnoses.</p>
  <p>People with higher education are diagnosed with more mental illness compared to those who are high school educated or below.</p>

  <p><a href="../codes/exploring data/DV Attempted Suicide 2008-2020.html">Attempted Suicide 2008-2020</a></p>
  <p>Age groups 18-20 and 21-25 share similar trends and significantly higher attempted suicide numbers compare to older age groups. 18-20-year-old young adults have the highest numbers of attempted suicide, while 21-25-year-old adults have the second highest numbers. The age group 60-64 has the lowest number of attempted suicide.</p>
  <p>The statistics collected show that females have a higher attempted suicide number compared to their male counterparts. Among all races, Asian has the lowest number and White has the highest. However, further analysis should take the percentages of each race in the American population into consideration. White Americans have a larger population compared to Asian Americans. Thus, the result doesn't surprise me.</p>
