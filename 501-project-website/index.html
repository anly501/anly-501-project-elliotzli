        <p  style="font-size:16px;">Elliot Li, as a Georgetown Data Science & Analytics Program candidate, expressed interests in finance from an early age. Both my parents has worked in the finance industry for over 20 years. As a child, I was deeply immersed in the business environment. My father would take me to his MBA classes, and my mother would work on accounting sheet while baby-caring me. When I applied for college, I chose finance as a major for my bachelor degree program at the University of Connecticut, and proceed to show ambition of merging finance with data science, to better serve my future goals.</p>
