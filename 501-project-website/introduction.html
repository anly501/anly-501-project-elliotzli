  <p>It has become clear that a disproportionated percentage of the younger generations suffer from degrees of mental illness. Although there are plenty of researches on this topic, I’m interested in exploring the topic from a holistic perspective. From brief research, my understanding is that youth mental illness has a more significant correlation to the rise of electronics and social media. As a Gen-Z and mental health patient, I’m curious of the truth behind it; thus, giving me a deeper understanding and how to improve the current situation. </p>
