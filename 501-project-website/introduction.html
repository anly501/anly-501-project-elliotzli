  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become clear that a disproportionated percentage of the younger generations suffer from degrees of mental illness. Quote from WHO: “Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school, and in the wider community are important.” Although there is plenty of research on this topic, I’m interested in exploring the topic from a holistic perspective. From brief research, my understanding is that youth mental illness correlates to the rise in the usage of recreational substances to some extent. As a Gen-Z, LGBTQ+ member, and psychiatric patient, I’m curious about the truth behind it; thus, giving me a deeper understanding and how to improve the current situation. </p> 
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I intend to collect data on age, demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. Some of the questions that may be answered in the projects are:</p>
  </td>

  <td>
  <p>Is the younger population more exposed to mental illness compared to the previous generations?</p>
  <p>To what degree do sexual identity and orientation contribute to youth mental illness?</p>
  <p>What percentage of mental patients actively seek medical/therapeutical intervention?</p>
  <p>Is the younger population more exposed to addictive substances?</p>
  <p>Which substances are most used among younger populations?</p>
  <p>How does economic and social background affect one’s substance use?</p>
  <p>Is there a positive correlation between substance use and mental illness?</p>
  <p>Is the suicide rate increasing among younger populations?</p>

    <p>Previous Research</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked closely with sexual minorities in college and read several research papers on this topic. For example, in “Trends in Violence Victimization and Suicide Risk by Sexual Identity Among High School Students — Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 2015–2019”, the author expressed concern about violence against the LBG (Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay) community in high school settings, and the aftermath of violence and suicides. In “Minority stress and mechanisms of risk for depression and suicidal ideation among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth”, the researchers validated the hypothesis that minority stress contributes to depression and suicide for LGBTQ youth.</p>
