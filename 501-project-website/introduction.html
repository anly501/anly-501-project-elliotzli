  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>It has become clear that a disproportionated percentage of the younger generations suffer from degrees of mental illness. Although there are plenty of researches on this topic, I’m interested in exploring the topic from a holistic perspective. From brief research, my understanding is that youth mental illness has a more significant correlation to the rise of electronics and social media. As a Gen-Z and mental health patient, I’m curious of the truth behind it; thus, giving me a deeper understanding and how to improve the current situation.</p>  -	Types of mental illness that the target population have.</p> 
  -	In what degree does the rise of online platforms impact the mental health of the target population.</p> 
  -	Popular treatments (physical therapy, medical intervention, etc.)</p> 
  -	How does the target audience’s presentence in school impacted their mental health?</p> 
  -	How does the target audience’s presentence at home impacted their mental health?</p> 
  -	Is there a correlation between the possibility of getting mental illness and their sexual orientation?</p> 
  -	Is there a correlation between the possibility of getting mental illness and their ethnicity?</p> 
  -	Is there a correlation between the possibility of getting mental illness and their family background (economic, relationship, political, disease history, etc.)</p> 
  -	What percentage of youth who suffered from cyber-bullying have mental illness</p>
